# Website blocker for mac and linux 

This program is built to prevent you from looking at certain websites during a certain time of the day, for instance I block facebook from 8am-4pm. Boosting productivity was the goal for this project, the file path is specific to mac and Linux and this will not run successfully on windows

Light enough to run in the background 


## Getting Started

This is run from the command line so you have full control of when sites are blocked 

```git clone git@github.com:DaneRosa/WebsiteBlocker.git```



### Prerequisites

!! THIS WILL EDIT YOUR HOSTS FILE !!

Restricted to mac and linux


## Running the tests

Open the blocker.py file and within the `website_list` array add the websites you'd wish to block 

Within the `While` loop select the timeframe that you would like to block the selected sites between

## Run

``` sudo python3 blocker.py ```
